# vercel-python-site
Making a website with Python and Flask as an assignment for Reaktor and while I didn't finish it in time, I started from knowing nothing and learned quite a bit.  
I had used python before, but not flask at all and decided to use vercel as my hosting site.  I managed to make it get drones and corresponding pilot information if they were close enough to the nest from the site every three seconds to not overload it with requests and delete all this after ten minutes and to update the development server with turboflask dynamically so you didn't need to refresh the page yourself. Currently it doesn't print all the information on the site though as I had some trouble with this and after some time I found out vercel doesn't support turboflask so I had to start looking into other options, but by then I didn't have enough time anymore to finish all of it in time. I am going to continue developing this little task though as I found it rather fun and interesting.  
Github displays two contributors because I've been using my brother's old laptop for development as well and didn't realise to change the settings for github on it.
